# brum-brum
Repo for the BrumBrum app, created as part of a 4-person group software development project. BrumBrum is a fictitious taxi and delivery company for whom we designed and implemented an Uber-style taxi app for. This was created entirely in Java in March 2017.

The system follows a client-server architecture with a persistent databse for storing customer, driver, and ride information. My main contributions were server-side and in querying the database.

Users can sign up as either a customer or driver, and can request/accept rides, edit their details, and retrieve previous ride information.
